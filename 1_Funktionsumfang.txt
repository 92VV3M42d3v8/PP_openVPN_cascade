MAIN SCRIPT
-----------

- Automatic adaptation of the relevant variables for the watchdog script if these are changed in the main script
- automatic adaptation of the maximum HOPs in the updown script, if these are changed in the main script
- The number of HOPs can be set variably (ATTENTION: with '8' it becomes problematic and the connection is partly not established) => Recommendation: '2' to '4'
- Random determination of a connection duration between a freely selectable minimum and maximum duration
- Automatic clearing of the main script LOG when it rises above 20MB
- automatic construction of the initially defined HOPs based on the configs, which are located in the freely definable directory
- Random selection of the individual HOPs, taking into account that no HOP is connected twice per session
- definable timeout if a HOP cannot be reached -> then use the next random server
- Monitoring of the at least required, usable servers for follow-up connections
- Note in the LOG if more HOPs are required than configs are available
- Use the updown script to establish the connection from the 2nd HOP
- Creation of a separate TMUX session per HOP
- Determination of the script-relevant variables based on the current LOGs of the individual HOPs
- Existing connection check based on the last public IP determined (icanhazip.com)
- automatic tidying up from the 'inside out' when the current session has expired and a new session is to be established
- clean and 'speaking' logging in freely definable directories


WATCHDOG
--------

- constant monitoring of the current connection
- Check the current status of the connection
	- Wait when a new connection is established until the last HOP is connected
	- when all HOPs are connected, the public IP is checked regularly (icanhazip.com)
	- If the output node changes, the main script should be processed again
	- If a server in the cascade can no longer be reached, the main script should be processed again
