By setting up these scripts and services, automatic OpenVPN connectivity with 1 or more random servers is guaranteed for a random period of time. A manual connection with one or more HOPs is therefore no longer necessary. As the VPN locations change after the session has expired, enhanced security is guaranteed. The main script is designed to work continuously and to repeat the function just described continuously.

A system with a Linux distribution as the operating system is expected as the basis for use. The configuration was tested under Debian Buster Headless Server.

For use, it is recommended to block all connections to the Internet using firewall rules beforehand (short instructions are available). However, the ports must be allowed which, according to the OpenVPN configs used, are required to establish the connection.

Once the firewall rules have been set up, this ensures that no data packets reach the Internet via the physical interface (s) (e.g. before the script is executed; during a new connection after the session has expired; in the event of an error, etc.).

Thus, the script is also ideal for use on a router that works with a Linux distribution.
