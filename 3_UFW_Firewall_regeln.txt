### please adjust the physical network adapter (here: eno1) in the commands! ###
### also do not forget to release all ports / protocols beforehand which are additionally required !!! ==> e.g. SSH ###
### ATTENTION: please check beforehand in the OpenVPN config files which ports they are using (may vary), and adjust the ports accordingly in the following shares! ###
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 148
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 149
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 150
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 151
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 1148
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 1149
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 1150
sudo ufw allow out on eno1 to any proto udp port 1151


### only enter these two rules at the very end ###
### this blocks all unapproved ports / protocols that were not previously approved ###
### also adapt the physical network adapter here (here: eno1) ###
sudo ufw deny out on eno1 to any
sudo ufw deny in on eno1
